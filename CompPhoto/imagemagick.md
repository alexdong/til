1. [`trimmer`](http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/trimmer/index.php): `trimmer -s "all"  -b white -f 40 nyc.jpg nyc-trim.jpg`. The `-f` is important when trimming only takes off one side. Fred uses `20` in his examples but `40` seems to be a better value when the background is not pure white. Also note that the `sides` argument needs to be quoted.
