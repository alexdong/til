# Howto measure corporate performance

## ROA - Return on asset

We use **ROA** To evaluate how quickly the business can turn its assets into profit.

ROA = Operating profit / Total asset
We are between 4.69% and 7.94%. Over 5% is considered to be good.

1. Operating profit is the same as Net profit. It's Gross profit minus operating expenses.
2. EBITA is less relevant to companies who are early and cash poor. EBITA = (Operating profit + Interest income) / Total asset
3. By using "total asset" instead of "net asset", this formula focuses on how well the management team can earn money and deliberately ignore how well the business is able to juggle with money.

## EPS - Earning per share

EPS = Net income / shares

Our last three months are 0.00187, 0.00325, -0.0010.
