# Howto measure corporate performance

## ROA - Return on asset

We use **ROA** To evaluate how quickly the business can turn its assets into profit.

ROA = Operating profit / Total asset

We are between 4.69% and 7.94%. Over 5% is considered to be good.

1. Operating profit is the same as Net profit. It's Gross profit minus operating expenses.
2. EBITA is less relevant to companies who are early and cash poor. EBITA = (Operating profit + Interest income) / Total asset
3. By using "total asset" instead of "net asset", this formula focuses on how well the management team can earn money and deliberately ignore how well the business is able to juggle with money.

## EPS - Earning per share

EPS = Net income / shares

Our last three months are 0.00187, 0.00325, -0.0010.

* Sanford: 0.45
* Fisher & Paykel: 0.406
* Kathmandu: 0.161
* Vista Group: 0.062
* NZX: 0.053
* Michael Hill: $0.044
* Serko: -0.002
* Scott Technology: -0.124


## EV - Enterprise Value

EV + Cash = Debt + Equity

Equity is -22,900
Debt is 14,000
Cash is 15,000
EV = -22900 + 14000 - 15000 = -23,900

Equity = Market value x Shares

Current share value = -22,984 / 1,760,000 = -0.013

To make the per share value go up to $1/share, 
the market cap, or equity, needs to be $1,700,000.

If the company is debt free by end of 2023, 
we'll need to generate free cashflow $1,7600,000?

I find it hard to calculate EV this way because 
it relies on an external market to put a value on 
the per share price. 

Market Cap = EV + Cash - Debt

If, say, people are willing to pay $0.4 per share, 
they are saying that the EV is 

EV = Market Cap + Debt - Cash
EV = 1,760,000 * $0.4 + 100,000 - 10,000 = $803,000

5x EBITDA is a reasonable valuation for a public company.

EBITDA = Earning + Interest + Tax + Depreciation + Amortisation

Say our EBITDA is `(10282-2236+807+284)*4` with no cash. 
Then EV for 5x is 182,740; for 10x is 365,480.

Going the other direction, assume no debt and no cash on hand, 
to have a $1,760,000 MktCap, 
   5x EBITDA = 352,000
   10x EBITDA = 176,000

Say to retire with $100,000 from interest of 1.85% Term Deposit rate, 
one needs $5,405,000 in the bank. If the business is growing 2x
year over year and the business is valued at 10x, then the EBITDA
should $540,000. with 10% earning to revenue ratio, we are looking 
at an annual revenue of $5,405,000.

So this is saying that given 10% earning to revenue ratio, the business'
turn over is the total take home money. 
The higher earning to revenue ratio is, the better; 
The higher valuation per EBITDA is, the better.
